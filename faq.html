                <p>Welcum tu the culd ob nonja (con), most limited NFT collecksun on INJ.</p>
                <p>Con NFT's work a little different than a typical collection. We have developed a novel burning mechanism and revenue sharing opportunity to provide a real ROI to the top hodler in the collection. We have several types of NFTs within the collection:</p>
                
                <h3>Custom PFP NFTs</h3>
                <p>These are PFP NFT's made exactly to your specifications. Anything you can think of, our artist can conjure up for you. You can get your very own custom PFP by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Winning a PFP Slot Auction</li>
                    <li>Upon winning the auction, you can reach out to the team for your specifications</li>
                    <li>Once you're happy, you burn the PFP slot auction</li>
                    <li>Nonja team airdrops your custom NFT on chain</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Purchasing another custom PFP:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can burn custom PFP's to get you a new custom, just like winning a slot auction above</li>
                    <li>You can reach out to the team for your specifications</li>
                    <li>Once you're happy, you burn the PFP slot auction</li>
                    <li>Nonja team airdrops your custom NFT on chain</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>1/1 NFTs made by Nonja team</h3>
                <p>These behave like a typical 1/1 NFT's in other collections. They cannot be burnt for another NFT like the custom slots above. Before purchasing, if you are confused if an NFT is a custom or 1/1, reach out on TG and we will be happy to sort things out :)</p>
                
                <h3>Animated NFTs (ANFT)</h3>
                <p>These are custom animated PFP NFT's made exactly to your specifications. Anything you can think of, our artist can conjure up for you. You can get your very own custom PFP by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exchanging 3 CON NFT's back to the CTO</li>
                    <li>Once exchanged, you can reach out to the team for your specifications</li>
                    <li>Once you're happy, Nonja team airdrops your custom animated NFT on chain</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>What's the benefit of hodling?</h3>
                <p>Dun bi pusi, be a pard of the most based culd on INJ. Yu have the bikkest bols on INJ. Hodlers get exclusive NFT WL's, random dedicated raffles of 50,000-100,000 Nonja, and other airdrops of INJ eco tokens. For the top animated NFT hodler, you earn 10% of all of the revenue of the project. You read that right, we are the only NFT collection to have a significant revenue share of the entire project back to hodlers.</p>>

                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <h4>Can I list, relist, gift, etc. my custom PFP NFT, 1/1 NFT, ANFT?</h4>
                <p>Yes, it's yours, do whatever you want with it.</p>
                
                <h4>What's with the golden frames with testicles on them?</h4>
                <p>That was the original airdrop to OG holders of Nonja. Frames will never be minted again. They are the rarest of the rare in the collection. When exchanging a frame for an ANFT, as a thank you to hodlers, they will count for 2 instead of 1.</p>
                
                <h4>When does the top ANFT hodler get their revenue share?</h4>
                <p>Top hodler gets the revenue share at the end of each month. Snapshot to determine top hodler will happen on the final day of the month at 12:00pm EST. TG will give several reminders in the week following. Revenue share will be airdropped within 48 hours of snapshot.</p>
                
                <h4>What if there is a tie for the top hodler at the snapshot?</h4>
                <p>No one gets the revenue that month then. The revenue goes back to CTO. Revenue is for the most dedicated Nonja, ties will not be considered.</p>
                
                <h4>What does the Nonja CTO do with the raised revenue?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>40% gets sent to the INJ burn address to be wiped from supply forever</li>
                    <li>30% gets split amongst CTO team</li>
                    <li>20% gets put into Nonja community Treasury for future giveaways</li>
                    <li>10% is for top ANFT hodler</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>How long does it take for my custom to be made?</h4>
                <p>Typically within 72 hours of reaching out to the team. Don't be a dick, the team is making a piece of custom artwork.</p>
                
                <h4>What's the max supply?</h4>
                <p>200</p>
